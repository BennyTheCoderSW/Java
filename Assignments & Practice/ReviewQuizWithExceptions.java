//Created a Quiz class that contains an array of 10 multiple-choice 
//questions to which the user was required to respond 
//with an A, B, C, or D.
//Use the “Review Questions” from end of Chapter 12
// ^^^^^^^^^ First Step ^^^^^^^^^^ 
//Handle the user’s response if an invalid character was entered. 
//Determine whether an exception is thrown if the user 
//enters nothing—that is, 
//the user just presses the Enter key without making an entry. 
//^^^^^^^^^^ Second step ^^^^^^^^^^
//If so, improve the program by catching the exception, 
//displaying an appropriate error message, 
//and presenting the same question to the user again. 
//After each questions answered, 
//display a message if you got it correct or wrong 
//(if wrong provide correct answer letter)
//Save the file as “ReviewQuizWithExceptions.java”.
